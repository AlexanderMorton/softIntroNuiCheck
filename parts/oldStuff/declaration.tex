
I declare that, except where explicit reference is made to the contribution of others, that this 
dissertation is the result of my own research work in the Experimental Particle Physics group of the
School of Physics and Astronomy in the University of Glasgow.
It has not been submitted for any other degree at the 
University of Glasgow or any other institution.
