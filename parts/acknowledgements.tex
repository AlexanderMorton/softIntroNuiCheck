This work would not have been possible without a combined effort from many people. This mention is not absolute but focuses on people who have had the biggest contribution to my work. 

My work related to resonance searches would not have advanced without the help of Chris Pollard and Paul Mullen. Not only have they both explained many analysis techniques to me but they have persevered through many silly mistakes and my insistence on placing everything in my bashrc. 

With regards to track fitting. Igor Rubinskiy and Claus Kleinwort are the two most prominent names to mention. Combined they have taught me almost everything I know about the EUTelescope framework and track fitting. 

A thanks to Anna Turner for checking for silly mistakes in this report at unsightly hours.
